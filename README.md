# Auto Client
##### A command-line tool to generate a Javascript client-side API for a PHP REST API

## Introduction

This package provides a command-line tool for use either with the Laravel framework (as an Artisan command) or with the Electro framework (as a Workman command). 

*TO DO: provide an explanation of the rationale behind this library and some usage examples.*

> **Note:** currently, this tool generates code for use with AngularJS 1.x, and it expects an Angular service called `remote` of type `RemoteService`.
> <p>This requirement is temporary and it will be removed on a later version of this tool.

## Documentation

Additional documentation will be written, as soon as I find the time for it.

    'APIs' => [
      // Endpoint URL => [controller class, target directory, Angular module name] 
      'API/something' => [SomethingController::class, 'App/remote', 'App'],
    ],
  ],
  ///... the rest of the existing file
];
